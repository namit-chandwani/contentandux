								<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
								<p>The Content + UX group is dedicated to providing a productive and harassment-free experience for everyone. By joining our Slack workspace, you agree to adhere to this Code of Conduct. Anyone who violates it may be sanctioned or expelled from the Content + UX  group at the discretion of the Admin team.</p>

								<h3 class="major">Harassment</h3>
								<p>We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. This code of conduct applies to every member of the Content + UX group.</p>

								<p>Harassment includes:

    							<ul><li>Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.</li>
    								<li>Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.</li>
    								<li>Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.</li>
    								<li>Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.</li>
    								<li>Physical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.</li>
    								<li>Threats of violence.</li>
    								<li>Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.</li>
    								<li>Deliberate intimidation.</li>
    								<li>Stalking or following.</li>
    								<li>Harassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.</li>
    								<li>Sustained disruption of discussion.</li>
    								<li>Unwelcome sexual attention.</li>
    								<li>Pattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others</li>
    								<li>Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.</li>
    								<li>Deliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.</li>
    								<li>Publication of non-harassing private communication.</li></ul></p>

    							<p>Content + UX prioritizes marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The Admin team will not act on complaints regarding:

    							<ul><li>‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’</li>
    								<li>Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”</li>
    								<li>Communicating in a ‘tone’ you don’t find congenial</li>
    								<li>Criticizing racist, sexist, cissexist, or otherwise oppressive behavior or assumptions</li></ul></p>

    							<h3 class="major">Reporting</h3>
    							<p>If you are being harassed by a member of Content + UX, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact any member of the Admin team through a direct Slack message. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>

    							<p>This code of conduct applies to Content + UX, but if you are being harassed by a member of the group outside the Slack group itself, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Content + UX members, especially the Admin team, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from Content + UX based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Content + UX and behavior towards people who are not in Content + UX.</p>

    							<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

    							<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of Content + UX members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.</p>

    							<h3 class="major">Posting guidelines</h3>
    							<p>Content + UX is place for industry practitioners to discuss their work, share resources, and help others grow professionally. You're welcome to participate to your heart's content, provided you adhere to these guidelines:

    							<h4>Do not use a company name as your display name.</h4>
								<p>This is a community for people, not commercial interests. You may mention your employer's name in your profile description and/or use your work email to sign up, but you may not use a company name as your display name.</p>

    							
    							<h4>Keep your posts on-topic.</h4>
    							<p>Make sure the things you're sharing are relevant to the content community, and that they're posted in the right channel. A good rule of thumb is that if it's not content-specific or there’s not a direct application in a content-specific scenario, then it’s probably not ok.

    							<h4>Keep your posts unique.</h4>
    							<p>Do not post repeatedly, or without context, your links to pitches, events, products, or services, or any such resources that are not specifically content-related. While not expressly prohibited, we strongly discourage cross-posting and more often than not we delete duplicate posts.

    							<h4>No drive-by link bombs.</h4>
								<p>If you find something content-related worth sharing with the community, include some context. Why do you find it interesting? What did you learn from it? We're not asking for a thesis, just a little thoughtfulness. If you're posting a commercial link as your first post, don't.</p>

    							<h4>No self-promotion and no soliciting.</h4>
    							<p>Do not approach other members, either through public channels or private messages, with sales pitches. Do not mine the group for email addresses. Either of these violations may get your membership revoked immediately.

    							<ul><li>If you have a content-related project you want someone to work on, submit it to the #job-postings channel using this form: http://bit.ly/submitacontentjob.</li>
    								<li>If you're looking for work, review the #job-openings channel.</li>
    								<li>If you're sharing a blog post or article you've written, use #please-retweet.</li>
    								<li>If you're sharing a project you're proud of, use #celebrate.</li></ul></p>

    							<h5>Examples:</h5>
    							<p><ul>	<li><b>Okay:</b> You're teaching a content strategy workshop and you think members of the group would be interested in attending, so you post about it, explaining its direct application to content and UX practitioners if those details aren't immediately apparent.</li>
										<li><b>Not okay:</b> You submitted a pitch to a UX conference and want members to vote for it, so you post the link daily as the voting deadline draws near.</li>
										<li><b>Not okay:</b> You founded a startup that sells consumer electronics at a discount and you're asking members of this group to try it out.</li>
										<li><b>Not okay:</b> Posting your company's recent blog post about their "Top Ten UX Portfolio Tips."</li></ul></p>

    							<h4>Posting job openings</h4>
    							<p>After a lengthy discussion period that included some data analysis and a member survey, there was clear support among our members for more salary visibility in the group's #job-openings channel. As a result, as of March 11, 2019 we're piloting a job posting process aimed at encouraging pay equity through transparency.

    							<p>All job openings must be submitted through the form located at <a href="http://bit.ly/submitacontentjob">http://bit.ly/submitacontentjob</a> (any jobs posted directly to the channel will be deleted).

    							<ul><li>Openings that include salary details are automatically posted in full to the #job-openings channel within approximately 15 minutes.</li>
									<li>Openings without salary details are still permitted but they are held for one week, then posted to the #job-openings channel in an abridged form.</li>
									<li>Please do not post openings in other channels.</li></ul></p>

    							<p>Our goal is to incentivize the inclusion of salary information, without restricting the utility of the channel overall. An added benefit to this process is a streamlined job posting structure that makes it easier to scan the channel for the characteristics of most interest to the reader.</p>

    							<h3 class="major">Consequences</h3>

    							<p>Participants asked to stop any behavior violating this code of conduct are expected to comply immediately. In most first-time cases, posts in violation of this Code of Conduct will be deleted by a member of the Admin team and you'll receive a warning. That said, the Admin team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from Content + UX. In some cases, the participant may also be identified as a harasser to other Content + UX members or the general public.

    							<h3 class="major">Admin Team</h3>

    							<P>The Admin team consists of:

    							<ul><li>Jess Sand (group manager)</li>
    							<li>Clay Delk</li>
    							<li>Jess Hooper</li>
    							<li>Amanda McWilliams</li>
    							<li>Michael Metts (group founder)</li>
    							<li>Kenneth Yau</li></ul></p>

    							<p>You can reach us via direct message in the Slack group.</p>

    							<P>This code of conduct was last updated on <i>June 11, 2019</i> and is based on the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment">example policy from the Geek Feminism wiki</a>, created by the Geek Feminism community.</p>
